# Metagenomics workflow from raw sequencing data to metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs)

1. Preprocessing of raw sequencing data
2. Metagenome assembly
3. Quantification of scaffolds
4. Functional annotation of proteins with UniFam and KEGG
5. Binning and quantification of MAGs
6. Taxanomy analysis of MAGs
7. MetaCyc pathway reconstruction of MAGs
